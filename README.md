# Overwatch-2-Statistics
Hello! This is my final project for UNC Charlotte's **DSBA-5122** - ***Visual Analytics*** course!

[View my Streamlit App here!](https://scolandr-5122-final.streamlit.app/)

## Introduction

Blizzard's Overwatch 2 has a trend of changing characters that don't need to be changed. They'll make *over-performing* characters even *better*, or *under-performing* characters even *worse*. As an active player, it can be quite frustrating to play, which is why I made this! The goal of this project is to analyze data to make appropriate changes based off **competitive** gameplay.

By providing detailed analyses of character win rates and role-specific statistics, such as healing metrics for Support Heroes and eliminations for Damage Heroes, this data visualization offers valuable insights. With this information at their disposal, Blizzard, the creators of Overwatch 2, can make informed decisions to enhance the game experience.

This is an add-on of my Midterm Project, where I used Tableau to build an interactive dashboard of these statistics!

## Data Operation/Abstraction Design
The data for this analysis was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mykhailokachan/overwatch-2-statistics), then refined to remove unnecessary statistics (e.g., data on moves unique to specific characters). The operations involved in data preparation included data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the insights generated. Though the data says it is up to Season 4, a new character that was released in that season had not been included in the data, meaning the data is more likely to be from Season 3.

**Note: Pick Rate is a percentage of *all* Overwatch 2 characters across *all* roles!**

## Future Work
If given data on updated and more current seasons, I would like to continue to refine the analysis to accurately reflect the evolving gameplay dynamics of Overwatch 2, especially as the game approaches its 10th season.

I hope you find this as interesting to view as I did in making it!
